Hello Professor Aly,

We wanted to thank you for providing us an opportunity to expand on Computer Vision. It means a lot to me for people to open doors to new, greater 'worlds' for others.



To avoid any confusion when roaming through this folder, I've provided below what each directory consists of:

1) Code: Contains the models of YOLOv5, v7, and v8, along with a zipped Visual Studio project, allowing users to detect objects via integrated, laptop camera.

2) Documents: Contains PowerPoint presentation about project, along with a zipped Overleaf report and its PDF form.

3) Processed Media: Contains medium-processing information, including preprocess, inference, and postprocess times for each sample, each version, each used hardware.


Overall, it was a great project and am willing to expand on object detection. I'm thinking maybe even delve into training a model for computer vision within soccer/f√∫tbol. Anyway, thank you professor and I wish the best.


Sincerely,

Michael A. Tolmajian
