Hello, professor. This is Michael.

I wanted to mention that this project allows you to use your own laptop camera to test out each of the following 5 models of YOLOv8:

Nano (yolov8n.pt) -- fastest but least accurate
Small (yolov8s.pt)
Medium (yolov8m.pt)
Large (yolov8l.pt)
XLarge (yolov8x.pt) -- slowest but most accurate

It will give you this information anyway, haha.
If you hadn't figured already, you need a camera, at least the laptop-integrated one.

It also allows you to use either your CPU or GPU after model selection.

Take care and thank you.

P.S. The Visual Studio project is in a ZIP file for you to extract. 

Best regards,
-Michael A. Tolmajian
