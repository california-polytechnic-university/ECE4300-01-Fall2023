This project demonstrates the installation and performance evaluation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) using Darknet on an Ubuntu virtual machine, with a focus on analyzing its performance on an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor.

## Overview

This project focuses on the installation and performance evaluation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) using Darknet, primarily on an Ubuntu virtual machine running on an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor. The core objective is to assess and compare the performance of YOLOv3 across various computing environments and hardware configurations. This comparative analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different setups impact the performance of YOLOv3, a crucial factor for applications ranging from academic research to real-world implementations.

The environments and systems used for performance comparison include:

1. **Emulation (Qemu) with RISC-V**: YOLOv3's performance was evaluated on a RISC-V architecture emulated in Qemu, using the same image as the one loaded onto an FPGA. This setup provides insights into YOLOv3's functionality and efficiency in emulated environments.

2. **Mac Terminal**: Running YOLOv3 natively in the Mac terminal offers a perspective on its performance in a macOS environment. This is vital for understanding its deployment and efficiency on Mac-based systems.

3. **Ubuntu VM on Mac**: The performance of YOLOv3 was also evaluated on an Ubuntu virtual machine hosted on a Mac, providing an understanding of the virtualization impacts on Mac hardware.

4. **Windows Ubuntu WSL2**: Here, YOLOv3 was run on Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, shedding light on its performance in a Windows-hosted Linux environment. This is particularly relevant for users and developers in the Windows ecosystem.

5. **12th Gen Intel(R) Core(™) i7-12800HX (Bare Metal Ubuntu)**: Performance analysis was conducted on this high-performance Intel CPU running Ubuntu natively (bare metal). This setup represents a modern, high-end computing environment and serves as a benchmark for YOLOv3 performance on the latest Intel hardware.

6. **AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS (VMBox Ubuntu)**: The project's primary focus was on assessing YOLOv3's performance on this processor within a VirtualBox Ubuntu environment. This analysis is crucial for understanding the potential and limitations of YOLOv3 in virtualized setups on high-end AMD hardware.

Each of these setups offers unique insights into YOLOv3’s performance characteristics, helping to build a holistic view of its operational efficiency across different platforms and hardware configurations.

## Prerequisites

- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu (installed on VirtualBox)
- Darknet (YOLOv3 framework)
- AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor (Host machine specifications)

## Installation Guide

1. **Setting up VirtualBox:**
   - Download and install VirtualBox.
   - Create a new virtual machine for Ubuntu.

2. **Installing Ubuntu on VM:**
   - Download the Ubuntu ISO file.
   - Install Ubuntu on the virtual machine created in VirtualBox.

3. **YOLOv3 and Darknet Setup:**
   - Install necessary dependencies for Darknet and YOLOv3.
   - Clone the Darknet GitHub repository.
   - Compile Darknet using `make`.
   - Download the YOLOv3 weights.

## Running YOLOv3

1. **Testing YOLOv3:**
   - Use the command `./darknet detect cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights data/dog.jpg` to run object detection.
   - Repeat the detection task on the standard images (e.g., horses, dogs) multiple times.

2. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Record the time taken for each run.
   - Calculate the average performance time.
   - Note any observations regarding the performance on the VM as opposed to native hardware execution.

## Results

- Document the average performance time obtained from the tests.
- Include any screenshots or output logs.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the findings of the performance analysis.
- Discuss the potential impact of running YOLOv3 on a VM, particularly with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor.

## Future Work

- Suggestions for further experiments or performance optimizations.
