In 2020, amid transportation restrictions and pandemic-induced delays, a
shortage of Raspberry Pi devices was encountered. Consequently, the team's
objective is to assess alternative microcomputers with comparable or
superior capabilities to the Raspberry Pi 4. This evaluation involves a
comparative analysis of the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B,
Raspberry Pi 3, Le Potato by Libre Computer, and VirtualBox. The
assessment is conducted by implementing Computer Vision techniques with
OpenCV libraries on a Linux Operating System, specifically for color
recognition in both video and image formats. The key metrics under
examination include execution time, CPU usage, and memory utilization,
with a focus on comprehending their impact on overall performance and
overall cost analysis.
